# Testing Interesting Probability Concepts

This is a compilation of interesting probabilistic concepts that I wanted to verify for myself.

To run any script locally, assuming you have any version of Python 3 installed, do:
```
python {script_name}.py
```
Note that you can tweak the iterations / sample sizes for a given concept by modifying the last lines of each script.

## Late Night Conversations

I discussed the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) with a friend late one night.  It was challenging wrapping my head around it.

## An Algorithm to Live By

Was reading [Algorithms to Live By](https://smile.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions-ebook/dp/B015CKNWJI?sa-no-redirect=1), and stumbled across an interesting solution to the [optimal stopping problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_stopping).
